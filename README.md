# Vehicle-Classification

This project aims to develop a real-time vehicle classification system using AI and NVIDIA Jetson. The system can distinguish between different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles) based on images from cameras. This project enhances traffic management, toll collection, and smart city applications by providing accurate and efficient vehicle classification.
The project involves training a CNN model on a labeled dataset of vehicle images. Once trained, the model is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson device, which uses its GPU capabilities to perform real-time inference. The system processes video feeds from cameras, classifies the vehicles in the footage, and provides instant feedback, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic monitoring systems.

## The Algorithm

The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. Here's a detailed explanation of how the algorithm works:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply various filters to the input images to detect features such as edges, textures, and shapes. Each filter slides over the image, creating feature maps that represent different aspects of the input.

Pooling Layers: After the convolutional layers, pooling layers (like max pooling) reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This process makes the computation more efficient and the model more robust to small variations in the input.

Fully Connected Layers: The feature maps are then flattened and passed through fully connected layers. These layers combine the extracted features to make the final classification decisions.

Activation Functions: Non-linear functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

Training Process: The network is trained on a labeled dataset of vehicle images. The training process involves adjusting the model's weights using backpropagation to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual labels.

Deployment: The trained model is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson device. The Jetson's GPU accelerates the inference process, enabling real-time vehicle classification from camera feeds.
